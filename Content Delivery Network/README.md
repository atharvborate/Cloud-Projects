# CloudFront CDN Implementation Guide

## Introduction

Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content. This guide provides a step-by-step implementation process for setting up CloudFront to accelerate content delivery.

---

## Prerequisites

- An **AWS Account**.
- A configured **Amazon S3 Bucket** (for static content) or an **EC2 instance / on-premises server** (for dynamic content).
- Domain name registered (optional, if using a custom domain).

---

## Step 1: Set Up an Origin Server

### **Using an S3 Bucket as Origin**

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Open the **S3 Service** and create a new bucket (or use an existing one).
3. Upload your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
4. **Set Bucket Permissions**:
   - If making content public, disable "Block all public access" and update the bucket policy.
   - If using **Origin Access Control (OAC)**, grant CloudFront access instead of making the bucket public.

### **Using an EC2 Instance or Custom Origin**

1. Ensure the EC2 instance or server is properly configured to serve content.
2. Enable HTTPS and ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed.

## Step 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution

1. Open the **CloudFront Console**.
2. Click **Create Distribution**.
3. Under **Origin Settings**:
   - Choose your **S3 bucket** or enter your **EC2/server domain**.
   - Set **Origin Protocol Policy** to `HTTPS Only` (recommended).
   - Enable **Origin Shield** (optional, for additional caching efficiency).
4. Click **Create Distribution** and wait for deployment (\~10-15 mins).

---

## Step 3: Configure Cache Behavior

1. **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (for security).
2. **Allowed HTTP Methods**:
   - `GET, HEAD` for static sites.
   - `GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE` for APIs and dynamic content.
3. **Cache Policy**:
   - Use `CachingOptimized` for static content.
   - Set custom TTLs for frequently updated content.
4. **Compression**: Enable automatic Gzip/Brotli compression for better performance.

---

## Step 4: Configure Distribution Settings

1. **Price Class**: Choose a pricing tier (e.g., `Use North America and Europe` for cost efficiency).
2. **SSL/TLS Certificate**: Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for custom SSL.
3. **Logging**: Enable logging (optional, for monitoring traffic and issues).

---

## Step 5: Deploy and Validate

1. Once deployed, copy the **CloudFront Domain Name** (e.g., `d123abc.cloudfront.net`).
2. Test content delivery by opening `https://d123abc.cloudfront.net/sample.jpg`.

---

## Step 6: Configure a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **AWS Route 53** (or your DNS provider).
2. Create a **CNAME** or **ALIAS** record:
   - Name: `cdn.example.com`
   - Value: `d123abc.cloudfront.net`
3. Wait for DNS propagation.

---

## Step 7: Monitor and Optimize

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor cache hit ratio and response times.
- **Geo-Restrictions**: Block specific countries if needed.
- **Lambda\@Edge**: Implement custom logic at the edge (e.g., authentication, A/B testing).

---

## Conclusion

Amazon CloudFront is now successfully set up to accelerate content delivery. Users will experience reduced latency, improved performance, and enhanced security.
